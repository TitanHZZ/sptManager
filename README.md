To compile this project, you will a compiler (like Clang or gcc/g++) and "nlohmann json" from vcpkg and for windows, you will also need visual studio 2022. You will also need cmake for both platforms.
But, if you prefer to just use the pre built binaries, they are also available for both windows and linux.
