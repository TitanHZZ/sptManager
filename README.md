"Bypass" spotify ads on windows!!

To use this project, you will need to install vcpkg (a c++ dependency manager) and then install the "nlohmann" library ( a json parsing library ), you will also need visual studio 2022 and cmake.
NOTE: To use this app without a terminal window, you will need to run it as admin and with the latest version there is no need to use the spotify API (it now fully detects all the adds without the need for the API).
Now the pre-built binary is availabe on the releases section.

TODO: Implement linux support.
